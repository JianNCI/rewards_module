# New Reward System in all Funtech shops #

###  :speaker: We are implementing a new reward system which is simply give 10% of the customer purchase as reward/voucher. ###

### The purpose of this rewarding system is to enable the customer to use the voucher and place the order online by themselves through our website. ###

<hr>

<h2>Please Note: :pencil2:</h2>

- **Customer has to register or login on our website first, _No register or No email account = No rewards/voucher given_**
- **Vouchers are only valid used on placing the online order at funtech.ie(Everything we have in the shop can be found on the website)**
- **Rewards will be generated after the customer successfully make the payment, _if the product/item is refunded or cancelled, rewards will be cancelled automatically_**
